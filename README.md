create a new union and const as we didi for location and color.
at the moment we have starter, rare and filler as rarities. add rarety to the relict type.
make it so rare relicts can only be drawn in the shop if the player has more then 20 gold. also in the initially drawn relicts in the shop if the player has more then 20 coins we always draw exactly one rare and two others. in every reroll we just draw any. also make it that the initial starting relict is only one of rarety starter
